### Quick SQL for Storage Policies:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'payment-screenshots');

-- Allow authenticated users to read
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated reads"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'payment-screenshots');

-- Allow admins full access
CREATE POLICY "Allow admin all"
ON storage.objects
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'payment-screenshots' AND
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin')
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'payment-screenshots' AND
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin')
);
```
